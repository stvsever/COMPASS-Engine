    "Step 5: Mild cognitive inefficiency (processing speed/executive deficits) is consistent with depressive-cognitive phenotypes and limbic-prefrontal circuitry involvement.",

Neuroimaging reveals limbic-prefrontal disruption (bilateral hippocampal atrophy with ACC reduction). Clinically significant mood/anxiety symptoms (PHQ-9 16, GAD-7 13) co-occur with mild cognitive inefficiency and a pro-inflammatory biomarker state (CRP z=+2.34, IL-6 z=+1.78). Moderate polygenic risk for mood/anxiety disorders supports genetic vulnerability. Sleep disturbance and past psychiatric history further corroborate risk. Data gaps include cortisol/metabolic markers, lifestyle factors, and full demographics, and hypothyroidism may confound mood and cognition. Overall, convergent multimodal evidence supports a CASE of neuropsychiatric disorder requiring integrated management, with data gaps tempering precise prognostication.",
