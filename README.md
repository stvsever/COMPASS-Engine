-->

**COMPASS** is an advanced multi-agent orchestrator for clinical decision support, enabling precise phenotypic prediction by integrating hierarchical multi-modal deviation maps and non-tabular electronic health information. Our current system is customized for neuropsychiatric phenotyping with data from the UK Biobank ; developed as part of an internship project @ IIS BioBizkaia.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: A dynamic actor-critic team of specialized agents (**Orchestrator, Executor, Integrator, Predictor, Critic**) collaborates to synthesize complex diagnostic logic through iterative refinement cycles.
- **Scalable Nature of LLM-based Knowledge**: Leverages the vast pre-trained clinical and biomedical knowledge of state-of-the-art large language models (LLM) for high-precision phenotypic prediction without requiring task-specific training, or fine-tuning.
- **Semantic RAG Fusion**: Employs a "Smart Fusion" layer that prioritizes semantically relevant biomarkers using hierarchical embeddings and targeted context retrieval to maximize the information-to-token ratio.
- **Explainable Clinical Reasoning**: Generates multi-modal evidence chains and structured patient reports, transforming complex high-dimensional data signals into human-interpretable clinical narratives; including three diverse LLM-optimized XAI methods.
- **Deep Phenotyping Report**: A dedicated **Communicator** agent produces a `deep_phenotype.md` report that is evidence-grounded and explicit about missing data (no hallucinated metrics).
- **Live Dashboard**: Integrated real-time UI for monitoring agent reasoning, token usage, and cross-modal evidence synthesis as it happens.


## 🧠 System Architecture

COMPASS utilizes a sequential multi-agent workflow with iterative feedback loops.

## 🖥️ Interactive Dashboard

COMPASS features a real-time monitoring dashboard that provides full transparency into the multi-agent reasoning process.

</div>

Through the dashboard, you can:
- **Monitor Live Execution**: Track agent progress, elapsed time, and token consumption in real-time.
- **Inspect Execution Plans**: View the dynamic plans generated by the Orchestrator for each iteration.
- **Analyze Reasoning**: Deep-dive into the clinical narratives and cross-modal evidence chains as they are synthesized.
- **Audit System Logs**: Access structured execution logs for full traceability of all agent decisions and tool calls.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stvsever/COMPASS-Engine.git
   cd COMPASS-Engine
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**:
   Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```env
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```

## ⚡ Usage

### Quick Start (CLI)
Run the pipeline on a participant folder:

```bash
python main.py data/pseudo_data/inputs/SUBJ_001_PSEUDO --target "Major Depressive Disorder" --control "brain-implicated pathology, but NOT psychiatric" --backend openrouter
```

### Explainability CLI (Backend-only)
Run explainability methods on the selected final attempt:

```bash
python main.py data/pseudo_data/inputs/SUBJ_001_PSEUDO \
  --target "Major Depressive Disorder" \
  --control "brain-implicated pathology, but NOT psychiatric" \
  --backend openrouter \
  --xai_methods external,internal,hybrid
```

Each participant folder must contain four core input files (see data/pseudo_data/inputs):
```text
- data_overview.json
- hierarchical_deviation_map.json
- multi_modal_data.json
- non_numerical_data.txt
```
The first three JSON files are ontology-based structured feature maps created during pre-processing

Pipeline outputs (per participant) include:
```text
- report_{participant_id}.md        (standard clinical report)
- deep_phenotype.md                 (communicator deep phenotyping report, generated manually via UI or --generate_deep_phenotype)
- execution_log_{participant_id}.json (structured execution log + dataflow summary/assertions)
```

Backend notes:
- `Public API (OpenRouter)` is the default in UI/CLI.
- Local runs can be configured in the Advanced Configuration panel (engine, dtype, quantization, context window, and role-specific overrides).

### Docker (CPU/UI)

For a clean containerized UI/API workflow, see:

- `docker/README.md`

Short usage:

```bash
tar --exclude-from=docker/.dockerignore -cf - . | docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -f docker/Dockerfile -t compass-ui:local --load -
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="<your_openrouter_api_key>"
docker run --rm -p 5005:5005 --name compass-ui -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY="${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}" compass-ui:local
```

For Intel Mac/Linux/Windows builds, use `--platform linux/amd64` (see `docker/README.md` for the full matrix and troubleshooting).

> [!NOTE]
> Optional variant: includes local-inference deps (`torch`/`transformers`/`bitsandbytes`) for people who really want them.
> GPU acceleration is explicitly not here; use `hpc/`.

### HPC Example (Single GPU)

For a complete Slurm + Apptainer workflow example for single-GPU HPC execution, see:

- `hpc/README.md`
- `hpc/HPC_Operational_Guide.ipynb`

This includes step-by-step setup, single-participant validation, sequential batch execution scripts, and a didactic HPC notebook.

> [!NOTE]
> **Batch Configuration**
> Step 05 supports multi-disorder balanced cohorts via `DISORDER_GROUPS` and `PER_GROUP_SIZE` environment variables.
> Results, including confusion matrices and detailed analysis, are saved to the `results/` directory.

### Clinical Validation with Annotated Datasets

If your cohort includes ground-truth annotations (e.g., UK Biobank case-control labels), COMPASS provides automated validation tools that compute binary confusion matrices and deep statistical analyses across neuropsychiatric disorder groups.

```bash
# Run analysis manually after a batch completes:
python utils/validation/with_annotated_dataset/compute_confusion_matrix.py \
    --results_dir ../results/participant_runs \
    --targets_file ../data/__TARGETS__/cases_controls_with_specific_subtypes.txt \
    --output_dir ../results/analysis/binary_confusion_matrix \
    --disorder_groups "MAJOR_DEPRESSIVE_DISORDER,ANXIETY_DISORDERS"

python utils/validation/with_annotated_dataset/detailed_analysis.py \
    --results_dir ../results/participant_runs \
    --targets_file ../data/__TARGETS__/cases_controls_with_specific_subtypes.txt \
    --output_dir ../results/analysis/details \
    --disorder_groups "MAJOR_DEPRESSIVE_DISORDER,ANXIETY_DISORDERS"
```

For a detailed walkthrough, see `utils/validation/with_annotated_dataset/validation_guide.ipynb`.

For a hands-on walkthrough, run the included Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook COMPASS_demo.ipynb
```

The notebook includes separate backend controls for:
- Public API mode (OpenRouter model + context window)
- Local backend mode (model path/name + local runtime settings)

## 📈 Future Work

Key future development directions include:
- **Continuous Engine Optimization & Stability Refinement**  
  COMPASS is currently an active research prototype under rapid development. While the core architecture is functional, intermittent edge-case inconsistencies and overall suboptimal performance may arise. 
  
  We are continuously refining the multi-agent logic to enhance system-wide robustness and predictable behavioral stability.

- **Improved Frontend & Clinical Usability**  
  Ongoing work focuses on expanding the interactive dashboard into a more user-friendly clinical frontend, simplifying workflow monitoring, interpretation, and report exploration.

- **Dedicated DataLoader Agent for Raw Multi-Modal Preparation**  
  A major next step is the implementation of a specialized **Data Loader Agent** that automatically prepares raw neuroimaging, deviation-map, and electronic health inputs into a standardized `ParticipantData` container, ensuring seamless delivery to the **Orchestrator Agent** and reducing manual preprocessing overhead.

Together, these developments aim to strengthen COMPASS as a scalable, interpretable, and clinician-oriented framework for next-generation neuropsychiatric phenotyping and decision support.
