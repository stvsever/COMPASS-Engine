PRESENTING COMPLAINT:
Patient is a 45-year-old female presenting with a 6-month history of persistent low mood, profound anhedonia, and significant fatigue ("feeling like I'm walking through mud"). She reports early morning awakening usually around 4 AM and is unable to fall back asleep. 

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Symptoms began gradually following a period of high stress at work. She describes a "hollow" feeling and lack of emotional reactivity. She has withdrawn from her usual social circle and has stopped attending her weekly choir practice. Concentration is markedly impaired; she struggles to finish reading prolonged emails. Appetite is reduced with a 4kg weight loss over 2 months. She denies current suicidal ideation but admits to feeling that "life is a burden."

PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:
- First episode of depression at age 22 during university. Treated with SSRIs (Sertraline) with good response.
- Post-partum low mood requiring brief counseling (age 30).
- No history of mania, psychosis, or hypomania.

MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Hypothyroidism (managed on Levothyroxine).
- Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

FAMILY HISTORY:
- Mother diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (recurrent).
- Maternal aunt committed suicide in her 50s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
- Married, two teenage children. Works as a secondary school teacher. 
- Non-smoker.
- Alcohol: 1-2 units per week (reduced recently); no history of AUD
- Reportedly high psychosocial stress due to caring for aging parents.

MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:
- Appearance: Well-groomed but appears tired. Psychomotor retardation noted (slowed speech and movement).
- Mood: Subjectively "low" and "numb". Objectively depressed.
- Affect: Restricted and congruent with mood.
- Thought Process: Linear but slow latency of response.
- Perception: No hallucinations or delusions elicited.
- Cognition: MMSE 28/30 (lost points on serial 7s due to concentration).
- Insight: Good. She recognizes she is depressed.

NEUROIMAGING REPORT (Summary):
Structural MRI indicates reduced volume in the left hippocampus compared to age-matched controls (Z-score -2.1). Mild thinning in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. No white matter hyperintensities or evidence of ischemic changes.

LABORATORY RESULTS (Summary):
- Thyroid function: Euthyroid.
- CRP: Mildly elevated (4.5 mg/L).
- Lipid panel: Normal.

IMPRESSION:
Symptoms are consistent with a recurrence of Major Depressive Disorder, moderate to severe severity. Biological markers (hippocampal atrophy, elevated CRP, low BDNF) align with this diagnosis.
