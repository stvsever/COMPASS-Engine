# Patient Report: SUBJ_005_PSEUDO

**Generated**: 2026-02-16T20:49:09.603167

## Prediction
- **Classification**: CASE (Phenotype match found for: neuropsychiatric)
- **Probability**: 82.0%
- **Confidence**: HIGH
- **Target Condition**: neuropsychiatric
- **Control Condition**: brain-implicated pathology, but NOT psychiatric

## Evaluation
- **Verdict**: SATISFACTORY
- **Checklist**: 7/7 passed

## Key Findings
1. **[BRAIN_MRI]** Reduced social brain network connectivity (z=-1.5, 7th percentile, MODERATE effect)
2. **[COGNITION]** Social cognition deficit (z=-1.5, 7th percentile, MODERATE effect); emotion recognition accuracy z=-1.6
3. **[COGNITION]** Language pragmatics impairment (z=-1.2, 11th percentile, SMALL effect)
4. **[LIFESTYLE_ENVIRONMENT]** Elevated sensory sensitivities (noise_sensitivity_index z=1.6, 95th percentile, MODERATE effect)
5. **[GENOMICS]** Elevated social_communication_prs and sensory_sensitivity_prs (z=1.4 and z=1.5, 92nd/93rd percentiles, MODERATE effects)

## Clinical Summary
This 24-year-old female exhibits a cohesive neuropsychiatric phenotype characterized by longstanding social communication impairments, sensory processing sensitivities, and behavioral rigidity, supported by convergent multimodal evidence including reduced social brain network connectivity (z=-1.5), social cognition deficits (z=-1.5), elevated sensory sensitivities (z=1.6), and relevant genomic risks (PRS z=1.4-1.5). Clinical history lacks primary mood or psychotic features but aligns strongly with neurodevelopmental conditions like autism spectrum traits, distinguishing from non-psychiatric brain pathologies via prominent social-perceptual distortions. Biomarkers provide supportive but not originating evidence; recommendation for formal developmental assessment warranted.

## Reasoning Chain
1. Step 1: Prioritize clinical notes - longstanding social communication difficulties, sensory overload, routine preference, early language delay, no mood/psychosis; matches ASD-like neuropsychiatric phenotype, not pure neurologic control.
2. Step 2: Assess multimodal convergence - strong cross-domain patterns in social brain (z=-1.5), social cognition (z=-1.5), sensory (z=1.1-1.6), genomics PRS (z=1.4-1.5); mean |z|~1.3-1.5 across key features.
3. Step 3: Evaluate against phenotype rep - fits neurocognitive/social cluster with moderate severity; hypotheses favor ASD vulnerability over schizophrenia prodrome.
4. Step 4: False positive check - explicit psychiatric-relevant symptoms (social/anxiety/sensory) with biomarkers; not isolated deficits or biomarker-only.
5. Step 5: Calibrate probability - strong clinical + convergent evidence elevates to moderately high risk (0.82), high confidence from multi-domain consistency; prevalence-adjusted avoiding overconfidence.
