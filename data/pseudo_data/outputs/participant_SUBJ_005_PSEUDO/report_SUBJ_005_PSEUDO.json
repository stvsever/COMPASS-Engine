    "Step 3: Evaluate against phenotype rep - fits neurocognitive/social cluster with moderate severity; hypotheses favor ASD vulnerability over schizophrenia prodrome.",
    "Step 4: False positive check - explicit psychiatric-relevant symptoms (social/anxiety/sensory) with biomarkers; not isolated deficits or biomarker-only.",

  "clinical_summary": "This 24-year-old female exhibits a cohesive neuropsychiatric phenotype characterized by longstanding social communication impairments, sensory processing sensitivities, and behavioral rigidity, supported by convergent multimodal evidence including reduced social brain network connectivity (z=-1.5), social cognition deficits (z=-1.5), elevated sensory sensitivities (z=1.6), and relevant genomic risks (PRS z=1.4-1.5). Clinical history lacks primary mood or psychotic features but aligns strongly with neurodevelopmental conditions like autism spectrum traits, distinguishing from non-psychiatric brain pathologies via prominent social-perceptual distortions. Biomarkers provide supportive but not originating evidence; recommendation for formal developmental assessment warranted.",
